# **One-Page Dashboard UI Concept (Simplified)**


---

## ‚úÖ **How it Works (User Interaction)**

* Each service has a simple **toggle (enable/disable)**:

  * **Enable:** Automatically generates a unique, disposable URL.
  * **Disable:** Instantly deactivates and removes URL/service.

* **No additional input required** from users.

* URLs auto-generated and expire after predefined time (e.g., 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr).

* Clearly shows active services with remaining expiry time.

# üöÄ **Why This Simplified UI is Ideal:**

* **Zero friction:** Instantly accessible.
* **Developer-friendly:** Clearly communicates state.
* **Scalable:** Easily add more services later without complexity.
* **Clean UX:** Intuitive and straightforward.
