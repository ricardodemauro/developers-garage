\;lha# Steganography Widget – Business Specification

## Overview

The Steganography widget is a privacy and security-focused tool within the Developers Garage platform that enables users to conceal and retrieve textual messages inside image files. This tool serves educational, research, and legitimate privacy use cases, allowing users to experiment with information hiding and secure message exchange in a straightforward, accessible way.

## Purpose & Value Proposition

* **Educational Utility:** Provides an intuitive interface for developers, students, and security professionals to learn about and experiment with digital steganography techniques.
* **Developer Convenience:** Offers an instant, no-signup solution to embed or extract hidden messages within images for demos, secure sharing, or research.
* **Privacy Testing:** Supports development and validation of security-conscious applications where steganography may play a role in watermarking, secure communication, or anti-tampering features.

## Supported Use Cases

* **Hiding Textual Data:** Users can easily conceal short messages or codes (including base64-encoded text) within standard image files.
* **Extracting Hidden Data:** Users can upload an image to discover if any hidden message is present and read its contents.
* **Proof of Concept:** Enables developers to demonstrate steganographic techniques in educational or professional settings.

## Key Features

* **Image-Only Support:** The tool is limited to image files (PNG, JPG, BMP) for both embedding and extraction.
* **Text-Based Payload:** Any plaintext, including base64 text, can be hidden or extracted.
* **No Registration:** Available to all users without the need for an account or authentication.
* **Temporary Processing:** All files are processed in-browser when possible, ensuring user privacy and minimal server storage.
* **Clear Disclosure:** Transparent indication that the tool is intended for educational and legitimate use only.
